# toolchainPic32Clang
Use modern Clang in MPLAB X for your PIC32-based projects!

# License
This projects uses code from Microchip's example source code found in their MPLAB X SDK.  Their source code is currently unlicensed, but contact with Microchip has indicated that their currently policy is to allow anyone to use their code as long as it is being used for or on Microchip products.  Microchip is currently working on an SDK license that will handle open source projects, at which point I will update this project with a "real" license (I plan to use an MIT license if their license allows).

For now, you should assume that you are bound by the same terms.  That is, feel free to use this code however you like, but keep in mind that it uses Microchip code and thus you should probably use it only for your own PIC or MPLAB X projects.  Also, I'll add the standard disclaimer about you using this at your own risk, no warranty, blah blah blah,...may leave toilet seat up...whatever.
